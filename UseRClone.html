<h3>Register an account on a cloud provider</h3>

<h3>Your uploads are non encrypted</h3>
<p>The cloud provider uses text mining and image recognition
to sell your ad-profile.

<h3>Now configure Rclone on that cloud</h3>
<p>For this example I have
<ul><li><a href="https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_config/">Configured Rclone</a> on this cloud account</li>
<li><a href="https://rclone.org/crypt/">Configured Rclone encryption</a> on the <b>Crypted</b> subfolder</li></ul></p>

<h3>Now drag and drop, it's encrypted</h3>
<p>The OS sees the account as a remote disk. On the screenshot you
can see that both the Rclone normal access to this account and
the Rclone encrypted access are "MacOS Volumes".
The volume on the left is the encrypted one, while on the right
you see what's stored on the cloud.
